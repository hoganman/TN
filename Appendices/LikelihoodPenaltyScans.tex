This appendix examines the $\pod$-only BANFF fit penalty terms $\chi_{\text{Flux}}^{2}+\chi_{\text{xsec}}^{2}+\chi_{\text{Det}}^{2}$
response (scans) to variations in flux and cross section parameters.
In addition, comparison scans are provided for the FGD MaCH3/BANFF
2017 analysis. In all cases, the penalty terms overlap indicating
the parameters have the same prior constraints between analyses.
