This appendix is a tabulation of variations of the cross section parameters
and their uncorrelated affect on the analysis samples. The variations
are shown in \Cref{tab:Nsigma}. Note that the ``nominal'' column
refers to all weighted events in the sample. When a ``$\pm1\sigma$''
variation is applied, the corresponding fractional change is reported.
